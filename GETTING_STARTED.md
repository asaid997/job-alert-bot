| `LINKEDIN_PASSWORD` | Your LinkedIn password |

### Phase 4: Enable Automation (2 minutes)

- [ ] Click "I understand my workflows and want to enable them"
- [ ] Edit `.github/workflows/job-alert.yml`
- [ ] Uncomment the schedule lines (remove the `#`):

  ```

### Phase 5: Test Your Setup (3 minutes)

- [ ] Click **Run workflow** button (green button on the right)
- [ ] Wait for the workflow to complete (should take 1-2 minutes)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Indicators

After completing the setup, you should see:
- âœ… Green checkmark on your workflow run
- âœ… Messages in your Telegram chat with job listings
- âœ… Emoji-formatted job alerts with company names and links

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### No Telegram Messages?
1. Check if your bot token and chat ID are correct
2. Make sure you sent `/start` to your bot
3. Verify the secrets are spelled exactly right (case-sensitive)

### Workflow Failing?
1. Click on the failed workflow to see error details
2. Common issue: LinkedIn login problems (check credentials)
3. Try running the workflow again (sometimes it's temporary)

### No Jobs Found?
1. This is normal if there are no new jobs in the time range
2. The bot only shows jobs posted in the last 48 hours by default
3. Try changing locations or keywords (see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md))

## ðŸ”„ What Happens Next?

Once set up successfully:
- Your bot will automatically run every 10 minutes
- You'll get Telegram notifications for new DevOps jobs in Israel and Netherlands
- The bot maintains a LinkedIn session to avoid repeated logins
- You can manually trigger runs anytime from the Actions tab

## ðŸŽ¨ Ready to Customize?

Now that it's working, you might want to:
- **Change job types**: Edit keywords in `temp.py` (see [README.md](README.md))
- **Add locations**: Include more countries/cities  
- **Adjust frequency**: Change the cron schedule
- **Customize messages**: Modify the Telegram format
